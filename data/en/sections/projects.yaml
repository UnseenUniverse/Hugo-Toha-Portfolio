  summary: Fish Feast was created by a group of 8 Game Developer students over the course of 48 hours during UW Stout's 2023 Game Jam hosted by the on campus IGDA club. In Fish Feast you play as a fish where your goal is to eat other fish and items in the ocean to eventually get big enough to eat the whole map! Fish Feast won the Most Innovative award. Feel free to click the link to play the game in browser!
